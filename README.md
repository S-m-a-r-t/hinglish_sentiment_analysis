# hinglish_sentiment_analysis
This project builds a sentiment analysis model for Hinglish text (Hindi in Roman script with English). A dataset of 50,000 English sentences was translated to Hindi and transliterated into Hinglish to create training data. Models including IndicBERT and XLM-R were trained to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.
